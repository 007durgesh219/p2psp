IMS can be enabled if IP multicast is avaiable for connecting the
peers of the team.

\subsection{Rules}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The splitter sends the stream (of chunks) to a IP multicast
  address:port (channel), which peers listen to.

\item Incomming peers contact the splitter in order to join know the
  channel.

\item Chunks are enumerated by the splitter and buffered in the peers
  in order to hide the network jitter. We define:

\begin{verbatim}
IMS_packet = [chunk_index, chunk]
\end{verbatim}

   Each peer can use a different buffer size $B$. By performance
   reasons, it must be hold that
   
   \begin{equation}
     M = pB
   \label{eq:chunk_index_buffer_size_relation}
   \end{equation}

   where $M-1$ is the maximun chunk index and $p$ is a positive integer.
\end{enumerate}
