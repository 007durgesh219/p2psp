(Mini) Bazaar manual
====================

I want to:

* Show my status (<launchpad_username> and <email>) in Lauchpad:

bzr config

* Se the Lauchpad user ID:

bzr launchpad-login <launchpad_username>

* Copy of the "trunk" branch into a "trunk"-named directory:

bzr branch lp:p2psp trunk

2. See all the branches of the P2PSP project:

cat << EOF | python - p2psp
import os, sys
from launchpadlib.launchpad import Launchpad

cachedir = os.path.expanduser("~/.launchpadlib/cache/")
launchpad = Launchpad.login_anonymously('find_branches',
                                        'production',
                                        cachedir)

try:
    project = launchpad.projects[sys.argv[1]]
    for b in project.getBranches():
        if b.lifecycle_status not in ["Abandoned", "Merged"]:
            print b.bzr_identity
except KeyError:
    print "Project unknown... \nUsage: " + sys.argv[0] + " lp_project_name"
EOF

3. Copy the branch <branch> into a <branch>-named directory:

bzr branch <branch>

4. Commit changes:

bzr commit -m "a description of your changes"
bzr push

5. Update my branch:

bzr pull

6. Create a new personal branch in Lauchpad:

bzr push lp:~<lp-username>/p2psp/<branch-name> 

7. Create a new shared branch in Lauchpad:

bzr push lp:~p2psp/p2psp/<branch-name>

* Create a +junk branch <branch-name> inside of the P2PSP project
  (+junk branches do not show up in any project's branch listing):

bzr push lp:~p2psp/+junk/<branch-name>

* Merging your branch (on your branch) with the trunk branch:

bzr merge lp:p2psp

* Summit a "Propose for merging". Go to:

https://launchpad.net/p2psp

* Merging the trunk branch (on the trunk branch) with a proposed for
  merging <branch>:

bzr merge <branch>
