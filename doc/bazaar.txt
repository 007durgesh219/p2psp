(Mini) Bazaar manual
====================

# Basic instructions:

1. Show my status (<launchpad_username> and <email>) in Lauchpad:

bzr config

2. Set the Lauchpad user ID:

bzr launchpad-login <launchpad_username>

3. Copy of the "trunk" branch into a "trunk"-named directory:

bzr branch lp:p2psp trunk

4. See all the branches of the P2PSP project:

cat << EOF | python - p2psp
import os, sys
from launchpadlib.launchpad import Launchpad

cachedir = os.path.expanduser("~/.launchpadlib/cache/")
launchpad = Launchpad.login_anonymously('find_branches',
                                        'production',
                                        cachedir)

try:
    project = launchpad.projects[sys.argv[1]]
    for b in project.getBranches():
        if b.lifecycle_status not in ["Abandoned", "Merged"]:
            print b.bzr_identity
except KeyError:
    print "Project unknown... \nUsage: " + sys.argv[0] + " lp_project_name"
EOF

5. Copy the branch <branch> into a <branch>-named directory:

bzr branch <branch>

6. Commit changes:

bzr commit -m "a description of your changes"
bzr push

7. Update my branch:

bzr pull

8. Create a new personal branch in Lauchpad:

bzr push lp:~<lp-username>/p2psp/<branch-name> 

9. Create a new shared branch in Lauchpad:

bzr push lp:~p2psp/p2psp/<branch-name>

10. Create a +junk branch <branch-name> inside of the P2PSP project
    (+junk branches do not show up in any project's branch listing):

bzr push lp:~p2psp/+junk/<branch-name>

11. Merging your branch (on your branch) with the trunk branch:

bzr merge lp:p2psp

12. Summit a "Propose for merging". Go to:

https://launchpad.net/p2psp

13. Merging the trunk branch (on the trunk branch) with a proposed for
    merging <branch>:

bzr merge <branch>

14. Generate a SSH public key:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

15. Upload a new ssh key. Copy the content of:

~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

into:

https://launchpad.net/~your-lauchpad-username/+editsshkeys

16. Get a branch of P2PSP:

bzr branch lp:~your-lauchpad-username/p2psp/branch-name

# Complex operations:

1. Get an existing branch to contribute: 14 + 15 + 16.
