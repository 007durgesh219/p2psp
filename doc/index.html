<h1 id="peer-to-peer-straightforward-protocol-p2psp"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Peer-to-Peer Straightforward Protocol (P2PSP)</h1>
<h1 id="definition"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Definition</h1>
<p>P2PSP is an application-layer protocol designed for real-time broadcasting of data on a P2P overlay network. P2PSP mimics the IP multicast behaviour, where a source sends only a copy of the stream to a collection of peers which interchange between them those chunks of data that are needed for the rest of the peers.</p>
<h1 id="motivation"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Motivation</h1>
<p>Efficient large scale distribution of media (real-time video, for example) is one of the big challenges of the Internet. To achieve this, IETF designed IP multicast. In this transmission model, a source sends only one copy of the stream which is delivered to a set of receivers thanks to the automatic replication of data in the IP multicast routers. Unfortunately, IP multicast does not fit the bussines model of most Internet Service Providers (ISP) which disables this functionality to end-users.</p>

<p>There are plenty of P2P straeming protocols. Depending on the overhaly topology, they can be clasified in chains, trees or meshes. A chain overlay is quite rare because churn can degrade significatively the Quality of Service (QoS) of the overlay, however, it has interesting characteristics such as peers does not need to interchange buffer maps and peers only send a copy of the stream regardless of the size of the overlay (we will refeer to this characteristics as &quot;replication factor&quot;). Tree overlays impose that peers must send so many copies of the stream (replication factor) as the degree of the tree, but like chains, the protocol is also push-based. Mesh-based protocols are more flexible regarding the overlay topology (which can be any) but peers must known the state of the buffer of their neighbours (the protocol is pull-based), and also are more flexible about the replication factor, which can be any. Obviously, push-based protocols are more efficient than pull-based one in terms of bandwidth.</p>
<p>P2PSP is a fully-connected mesh-structured push-based protocol. Being <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> the number of peers in the overlay (a &quot;team&quot; in the P2PSP jargon), <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> is degree of the mesh. The replication factor in P2PSP is 1 by default, although as in mesh-based protocolos, it can be any other depending on the solidarity between the peers.</p>
